		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

	<p> <!-- drugi paragraf -->
		CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that "all heading 1 elements should be bold," leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts "this text is a level 1 heading" without formatting code such as a <mark>&lt;bold&gt;</mark> tag indicating how such text should be displayed.

		In CSS, selectors are used to declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself. Selectors may apply to:

	<p>  <!-- LISTA -->
		<ol>
			<li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second level headers h2</li>
			<li>
				elements specified by attribute, in particular:			
				<ul>
					<li> <b>id</b>: an identifier unique to the document</li>
					<li> <b>class</b>: an identifier that groups multiple elements in a document</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
		</ol>
